"""
Time Complexity:
- push: O(1)
- pop: Amortized O(1), due to transferring elements from in_stack to out_stack only when out_stack is empty
- peek: Amortized O(1), due to transferring elements from in_stack to out_stack only when out_stack is empty
- empty: O(1)

Space Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue (e.g., 100 in this case)

Successfully ran on Leetcode: Yes

Notes:
- Initially attempted to implement the queue using a simple array, but realized it doesnâ€™t maintain FIFO order correctly.
- Then switched to the two-stack approach, which properly simulates queue behavior.
- Once the concept was clear, the implementation was straightforward.
